3 Phases to this Project out of which one phase is complete:
  1. Academic Document Verification
  2. Government Document Verification
  3. Invoice / Bill Verification System


Currently we have completed working model of the phase 1 i.e. Academic Document Verification 
This Academic Document Verification System uses advanced techniques to verify the authenticity of academic documents like marksheets and transcripts.

Key Features:
  1. Document Analysis: Uses OCR to extract text and information
  2. Data Validation: Performs multiple validation checks
  3. Anomaly Detection: Uses machine learning to identify potential fraud
  4. Verification History: Maintains a searchable database of documents
  5. Analytics Dashboard: Provides insights into verification trends
Technical Stack:
  1. OCR: Tesseract with custom preprocessing
  2. Machine Learning: Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
  3. Database: SQLite for document storage
  4. UI: Streamlit for interactive web interface
System Requirements:
  1. Tesseract OCR installed
  2. Poppler utilities for PDF processing
  3. Python 3.8+ with required packages
